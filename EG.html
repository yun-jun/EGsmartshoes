    <u><li>Introduction</li></u>
      <p>: We created the shoes named "EG Smart Shoes" and the idea from CES 2020 in Las Vegas.
      <br> Our product named "EG Smart Shoes" is a combination of many products which got an award for CES.
      <br> In CES 2020, we noticed that the products for preventing fall are really important for elderly.
      <br> When they got old, they had some problems about their balance. It can cause an serious injury when they fall down.
      <br> So we are helping ederly or people who are struggling with the balance problems by using "EG Smart shoes".</p>
